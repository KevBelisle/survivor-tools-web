# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a modern React web application built with TanStack Router, TanStack Query, and Tailwind CSS. The project was created using `create-tsrouter-app` and uses a file-based routing system.

## Development Commands

### Running the application
- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 3000
- `npm run build` - Build for production (runs both Vite build and TypeScript compiler)
- `npm run serve` - Preview production build locally

### Testing
- `npm run test` - Run tests with Vitest

### Code Quality
- `npm run lint` - Lint code with Biome
- `npm run format` - Format code with Biome
- `npm run check` - Run both linting and formatting checks with Biome

Note: The `start` script mentioned in README.md does not exist in package.json - use `npm run dev` instead.

## Architecture

### Routing System
The project uses **TanStack Router** with file-based routing:
- Route files are located in `src/routes/`
- `src/routes/__root.tsx` serves as the layout wrapper for all routes
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated by the TanStack Router plugin - do not edit manually
- New routes are created by adding files to `src/routes/` directory
- The router is configured with:
  - `defaultPreload: "intent"` - Preloads routes on hover
  - `scrollRestoration: true` - Restores scroll position on navigation
  - `defaultStructuralSharing: true` - Optimizes re-renders
  - `defaultPreloadStaleTime: 0` - Always preload fresh data

### State Management & Data Fetching
- **TanStack Query** is set up for server state management
- Query client context is provided via `src/integrations/tanstack-query/root-provider.tsx`
- The router context includes the `queryClient` for use in route loaders and components
- TanStack Router loaders can be used for route-level data fetching

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS v4** is configured via Vite plugin
- Global styles in `src/styles.css`
- Tailwind configuration is handled through the Vite plugin, not a separate config file

### Build Tools
- **Vite** as the build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
- **Biome** for linting and formatting (replaces ESLint and Prettier)
  - Uses tabs for indentation
  - Double quotes for JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Excludes `src/routeTree.gen.ts` and `src/styles.css` from checks
- **React Compiler** (babel-plugin-react-compiler) is enabled for automatic optimizations

### Path Aliases
- `@/*` maps to `src/*` (configured in both `vite.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`)
- Example: `import { Component } from '@/components/Component'`

### DevTools
The root route includes integrated devtools:
- TanStack Router Devtools (panel-based)
- TanStack Query Devtools (panel-based)
- TanStack DevTools (unified toolbar at bottom-right)

These are only included in development builds.

## Important Notes

- Files in `src/routeTree.gen.ts` are auto-generated - modifications will be overwritten
- The project uses React 19 and StrictMode
- React Compiler is enabled, which automatically optimizes component re-renders
- Biome configuration excludes certain generated files from linting/formatting
- Environment files (.env.development, .env.production) are present but not tracked in git
